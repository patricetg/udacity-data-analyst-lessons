    "So we have 88 Roger Ebert reviews to open and read, which you can see in the Jupyter Notebook dashboard below (click jupyter in the top lefthand corner to access the dashboard) in the ebert_reviews folder.

    "* the second line, which is the review URL (not necessary for the word cloud but nice to have)\n",

    "The Jupyter Notebook below contains template code that:\n",
    "* Creates an empty list, `df_list`, to which dictionaries will be appended. This list of dictionaries will eventually be converted to a pandas DataFrame (this is the [most efficient way of building a DataFrame row by row](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28058264)).\n",
    "* Loops through each movie's Roger Ebert review text file in the `ebert_reviews` folder.\n",
    "* Opens each text file using a path generated by [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) and passes it into a filehandle called `file`.\n",
